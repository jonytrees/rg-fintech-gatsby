      <p>Conversion Rate Optimization Test refers to the different types of testing methodologies used in the CRO to identify the best possible version of a certain ecommerce site. The best possible version of an ecommerce site is the one that brings in the most valuable traffic.</p>
      <p>This traffic can later be converted into leads generated from the ecommerce website. The process of improving this conversion rate is called conversion rate optimization. Both of these definitions are interlinked with each other.</p>
